# A window into a matrix is a contiguous sub matrix.

# Consider a 2 x n matrix where every entry is either 0 or 1.
# Let A(k,n) be the total number of these 2xn matrices such that the sum of the entries in every 2xk window is k.

# You are given that A(3,9) = 560 and A(4, 20) = 1060870.

# Find A(10^8, 10^16). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
