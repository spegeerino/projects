# In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

# 1/x + 1/y = 1/n

# It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n 
# for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.
# What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?
# _________________________________________________________________________________-
# nx + ny = xy --> xy - nx - ny + n^2 = n^2 
# (x-n)(y-n) = n^2, num sols is [#divs(n^2) + 1]/2
